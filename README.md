# Langchain Project

This repository contains a project using [Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), a framework for developing applications powered by language models. This project aims to explore and test Langchain's capabilities for building LLM-driven applications.

## Features

- **Langchain Integration**: Utilizing Langchain to manage the complex prompt engineering, chaining of models, and handling various LLM use cases.
- **Custom Pipelines**: Implementing custom pipelines for natural language processing tasks.
- **Modular Components**: Includes modular components such as memory, chains, and prompt templates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Install the required dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt# Langchain Project
